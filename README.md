## Documentation

See the [Go API docs](https://docs.objectia.com/go/).

## Installation

You don't need this source code unless you want to modify the package. If you just
want to use the package, just run:

```bash
$ go get -u github.com/objectia/objectia-go
```    

### Requirements

* Go 1.8 or later


### Development:

```bash
$ go get -u github.com/stretchr/testify/assert
```

## Usage

The library needs to be configured with your account's API key. Get your own API key by signing up for a free [Objectia account](https://objectia.com).

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/objectia/objectia-go"
)

func main() {
    apiKey := "<your API key>"
    client, err := objectia.NewClient(apiKey, nil)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    result, err := client.GeoLocation.Get("8.8.8.8", nil)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    fmt.Printf("Location: %+v\n", result)
}
```
